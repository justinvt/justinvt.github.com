            <p>Selected along with 2 other ME students, based on academic excellence, to participate in graduate level research for 5 terms. Under the auspices of Dr. Jaydev Desai developed graphics architecture,TCP/IP software, and Linux drivers for a surgical simulator with haptic (touch) and graphic feedback. The haptic feedback could be generated artificially or sampled from real world materials via a remote force sensor, allowing the simulator to be used for remote surgical procedures.</p>

Analyzed and adjusted redis configuration to save space and take advantage of redis' advanced data structures (hashes, sets, lists) to optimize disk usage. Developed an algorithm to prevent duplicates in user entered movies & tv series.
