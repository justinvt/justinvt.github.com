		description : "Framebuilder was a custom web application for a framing business.  Customers uploaded any image (for example a family photo or artwork), they selected a frames and mattes, and chose from a series of predetermined sizes.  The customer cropped and positioned their image within the frame, and the creators of Framebuilder printed the picture on large format canvas, framed it, and delivered it to the end user.  I developed all of the interactivity of the site, developed the front end website, created a RoR (Ruby on Rails) application to serve the front-end application, along with an administrative application for framebuilder to fulfill the orders."
